### Note :memo:
- If per case, the message fails on your screen, you should try again, because the second attempt is always right ;)
- To check if your phone is actually root access, run this command on some terminal emulator
```sh
    $ su
    # to look like something
    mlv5:/ #
    # you have root access! congratulations ;)

- (Required) To manage root access for each application, you must download the Magisk manager [here](https://magiskmanager.com/)
