# MediaTek easy root
- Get root access with one click
### Note
- If per case, the message fails on your screen, you should try again, because the second attempt is always right ;)
- To check if your phone is actually root access, run this command on some terminal emulator
```sh
    $ su
    # to look like something
    mlv5:/ #
    # you have root access! congratulations ;)
````
- To manage root access for each application, you must download the Magisk manager [here](https://magiskmanager.com/)

### Acknowledgment
- Thanks for the scrip that makes it possible Diplomatic
- Thanks to everyone of the forum of the Lg K10 in the XDA

### Warning
    WARNING: DO NOT UPDATE MAGISK THROUGH MAGISK MANAGER OR YOU WILL BRICK YOUR DEVICE ON A LOCKED BOOTLOADER
